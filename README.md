This is my second assignment project set by the TechEducators

Here are the sources I used in order to help create/fix on my HTML/CSS/JS code:

Using clip-path:
Create a custom shape for the clickable area using clip-path.
For example, to create a circular clickable area, you could use:
CSS
clip-path: circle(50% at 50% 50%);

Reflection:
On this project I decided to focus on the functional JS side, rather than the styling as I still feel I’m weaker in this area. In order to help me out I’ve added a lot of comments within the app.js file. Breaking it down and explaining what’s going on and why. By doing this I hope it will better my understanding if/when I view it at a later date. There may come a time when I need a function that will allow a specific action in a project, but I can’t quite remember how to write it or get it to work but I know I used it before in this project. This will allow me to refer back to this code base and understand what’s going on.
